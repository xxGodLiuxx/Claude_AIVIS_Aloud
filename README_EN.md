## Important Security Notice

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warnings

This tool uses **real-time JSON file monitoring**, which carries the following risks:

1. **File Access Permissions**: Requires read access to specific system directories
2. **Privacy**: Interactions with Claude Code will be read aloud
3. **System Resources**: Continuous file monitoring consumes CPU/memory
4. **Audio Output**: May be inappropriate in certain environments

**Use of this tool is entirely at your own risk.**

cd Claude_AIVIS_Aloud

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run the latest version
python claude_aivis_aloud.py

# Or use older stable version
python legacy/kanon_aloud_v3.2.1.py
```

### Configuration

Edit `config.json` to customize settings:

```json
{
  "voice": {
    "speaker_id": 1325133120,  // Speaker ID (see customization guide)
    "normal_volume": 1.0,       // Normal message volume
    "thinking_volume": 0.5,     // Think Hard Mode volume
    "engine_host": "localhost",
    "engine_port": 50021
  }
}
```

## Voice Customization

AIVIS Speech supports multiple speakers (voices). See `docs/VOICE_CUSTOMIZATION.md` for details.

### Quick Start

1. **Check available speakers**
   ```bash
   python examples/list_speakers.py
   ```

2. **Add new speakers**
   - Select a speaker from [AivisHub](https://hub.aivis-project.com/)
   - Example: [Kanon](https://hub.aivis-project.com/aivm-models/a670e6b8-0852-45b2-8704-1bc9862f2fe6)
   - Add via AIVIS Speech "Add Voice Model" menu

3. **Set speaker ID**
   - Update `speaker_id` in `config.json` with the confirmed ID
   - Each speaker style (Normal, Happy, etc.) has a different ID

## Troubleshooting

See the main [README.md](README.md) for detailed troubleshooting in Japanese.

### Common Issues

1. **"Cannot connect to engine" error**
   - Ensure AIVIS Speech is running
   - Check port 50021 is correct
   - Check firewall settings

2. **No audio output**
   - Check system volume settings
   - Verify audio device selection
   - Ensure `pygame` is properly installed
